    abstract = {Whether you need full-text search or real-time analytics of 
    structured data-or both-the Elasticsearch distributed search engine is an 
    ideal way to put your data to work. This practical guide not only shows you 
    how to search, analyze, and explore data with Elasticsearch, but also helps 
    you deal with the complexities of human language, geolocation, and 
    relationships. If you're a newcomer to both search and distributed systems, 
    you'll quickly learn how to integrate Elasticsearch into your application. 
    More experienced users will pick up lots of advanced techniques. Throughout 
    the book, you'll follow a problem-based approach to learn why, when, and 
    how to use Elasticsearch features.}
