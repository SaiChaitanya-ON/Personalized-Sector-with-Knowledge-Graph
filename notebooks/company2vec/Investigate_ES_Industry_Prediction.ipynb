With revenues of ~MYR490Mn, it is an investment holding company and primary activities of its subsidiaries include egg production, manufacturing of paper egg trays, production of animal feeds, production of organic fertilizer using chicken manure and trading and distribution of animal health products. In 2008, the company was listed on the Bursa Securities Malaysia and has a current market cap of MYR339Mn as at 01 Oct 2019. TSCB currently operates 25 farms (categorised into brooding, pullet and layer farms) in Johor, Malaysia.

       "  'description': \"Biofrontera AG, a biopharmaceutical company, engages in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions and diseases caused primarily by exposure to sunlight that results in sun damage to the skin.\\n\\nThe company\\x92s approved products focus on the treatment in the U.S. and Europe of actinic keratoses, which are skin lesions that could sometimes lead to skin cancer, as well as the treatment of basal cell carcinoma in the EU. The company conducts its own research and development and, in various regions, including the U.S., markets and sells its own products.\\n\\nFollowing the company\\x92s acquisition of Cutanea Life Sciences, Inc. (Cutanea) in March 2019, its principal focus would also include the commercialization of AKTIPAK and Xepi in the U.S. on the basis of their approvals, as well as identification of potential opportunities to further capitalize on those drugs, potentially by means of obtaining new regulatory approvals or geographic expansion.\\n\\nProducts\\n\\nAmeluz\\n\\nThe company\\x92s principal marketed product is Ameluz. Ameluz is used in photodynamic therapy (PDT) to remove tumor cells. It is selling Ameluz in the U.S., in 9 countries in Europe and in Israel. The company outsources the production of Ameluz to a third-party contract manufacturer in Switzerland. In the company\\x92s Phase III trials, the resulting redness and/or inflammation resolved within 1 to 4 days in various cases; in some cases, however, it persisted for 1 to 2 weeks or even longer.\\n\\nIn March 2018, the company received approval from the European Commission to include treatment of mild to moderate actinic keratosis on the face and scalp using Ameluz in combination with daylight PDT (i.e., using natural daylight to activate the drug), which it had applied for in 2017.\\n\\nBF-RhodoLED Lamp\\n\\nThe company\\x92s BF-RhodoLED is a red light lamp primarily designed for PDT, and uses LEDs emitting red light at a wavelength of approximately 635 nm to activate the photosensitizer. The red light emitted by the company\\x92s BF-RhodoLED lamp is outside the infrared range, reducing the likelihood for discomfort from warming. The company assembles its BF-RhodoLED lamp at its corporate headquarters in Leverkusen, Germany.\\n\\nThe company\\x92s BF-RhodoLED lamp is CE-certified and is distributed throughout the EU. Its lamp is approved in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a combination product for use in treatment with Ameluz. The company has been performing the final assembly of its BF-RhodoLED lamp at its facilities in Leverkusen, Germany since July 2016 and, thus, it is are considered the responsible manufacturer by the FDA.\\n\\nClinical Trials Relating to Field-Directed Treatment of Actinic Keratosis on the Extremities and the Trunk\\n\\nBetween July 2018 and March 2019, the company conducted a Phase III trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ameluz in combination BF-RhodoLED illumination for the treatment of actinic keratoses on the extremities, as well as the trunk and neck. This trial was a double blind, placebo controlled, intra-individual Phase III trial at four clinical centers in Germany.\\n\\nThe multi-center, randomized, double-blind, intra-individual study included various patients at six study sites in Germany, each with four to ten clinically confirmed actinic keratosis lesions in comparable areas on the right and left side of the extremities and/or trunk/neck. Mild, moderate and severe actinic keratoses were treated with one or two PDT treatments. The final examination of the patients took place three months after the last PDT treatment. The clinical study phase would be followed by a follow-up phase of twelve months after the last PDT, in which recurrence rates and/or numbers of new actinic keratosis lesions and skin tumors would be determined. This follow-up phase would be reported separately. The company intends to use results to file in the third quarter of 2019 for the label extensions with the European Medicines Agency in the EU and the FDA in the U.S.\\n\\nResearch and Development Programs\\n\\nIn addition to its approved products, the company also has various research and development programs.\\n\\nBasal Cell Carcinoma\\n\\nIn 2017, the company agreed with the FDA on the requirements necessary to obtain approval for its application of Ameluz PDT for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma in the U.S. In December 2017, the company filed an investigational new drug application with the FDA for its proposed Phase III study protocol to evaluate Ameluz PDT for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma, and FDA performed a special protocol assessment. The study was initiated in September 2018.\\n\\nFollowing the discussion with the FDA, the company has initiated the study with the following design. The primary objective is to compare the efficacy of Ameluz PDT with PDT using just the vehicle that is used to deliver the active ingredient in Ameluz, in combination with BF-RhodoLED illumination, in the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma. A randomized, double blind, vehicle-controlled multicenter Phase III study would be performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ameluz in combination with BF-RhodoLED. The company would work with 12 to 16 clinical centers in the U.S. and enroll patients to achieve an alpha level of p<0.001. Ameluz and placebo would be applied at a 4:1 ratio. The primary efficacy variable is the composite clinical and histological complete clearance rate of the patient\\x92s main target lesion, assessed at the end of the clinical observation period, 12 weeks after the start of the first or second PDT cycle. Each PDT cycle would consist of two PDTs one to two weeks apart. Secondary objectives include the evaluation of the safety and secondary efficacy parameters (including stratification according to lesion size, location, patient age and sex) related to Ameluz and BF-RhodoLED, also including clinical clearance of additional treated lesions on the same patients. The double blind clinical observation period for each patient would be approximately 7 months (approximately four weeks screening and pre-randomization period, and three or six months double blind part of the study) followed by a 5-year follow-up period after the start of the last PDT cycle. The recruitment phase started in the third quarter of 2018 and is intended to be completed by the end of the second quarter in 2020. Clinical trial results are expected by the end of 2020, and the company intends submission of its approval supplement to the FDA during the first half of 2021.\\n\\nPreparation of Additional Clinical Trials for Ameluz\\n\\nThe company has started preparation for the following phase III trials:\\n\\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma: The company is planning a randomized, double-blind, multi-center Phase III study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ameluz versus placebo in the treatment of Bowen\\x92s disease (squamous cell carcinoma in situ) with PDT when using the BF-RhodoLED lamp. The study is intended to have an inter-individual design similar in treatment regime and patient number to its planned trial for the treatment of superficial basal cell carcinoma in the U.S.\\n\\nAcne: A phase II trial is in the early planning stages. No trial design has been defined, and the company is collecting information of investigators with off-label experience in this indication.\\n\\nBF-derm1\\n\\nBF-derm1 is a drug candidate that the company is developing in the form of a tablet for the treatment of severe, chronic, antihistamine-resistant urticaria, or hives.\\n\\nThe BF-derm1 tablet contains an active ingredient that covalently binds to histidine decarboxylase that could be a mechanism of action to soothe chronic urticarial (hives). The project is not being actively developed. The company intends to focus on further commercializing Ameluz PDT in the next years, and it intends to seek a partner for the further development and funding of the Phase III costs and regulatory approval expenses relating to developing BF-derm1.\\n\\nBF-1\\n\\nThe company\\x92s BF-1 candidate involves a patented active ingredient that is intended to be used for the prophylactic treatment of patients who frequently suffer from migraines. It has conducted preclinical investigations concerning the tissue distribution, metabolism and toxicology of the substance. The company has further conducted a Phase 0 trial involving humans in which the substance was orally administered to healthy subjects, demonstrating favorable bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of the active agent. As this product candidate no longer fits its dermatological product focus, the company is not actively developing it, but it intends to explore licensing opportunities.\\n\\nDevelopment Collaboration with Maruho Co., Ltd. (Maruho)\\n\\nIn March 2019, the company signed an agreement to continue its collaboration with Maruho. As part of the newly agreed project phase, the company would prepare the formulation of one of the four active ingredients in its nanoemulsion jointly tested during Phase 1 for clinical trials. The agreement does not cover any potential clinical testing that might be carried out during a subsequent project phase. As with Phase 1, previously existing intellectual property, primarily the company\\x92s nanoemulsion technology, shall remain the property of the respective owner.\\n\\nThe company and Maruho have begun the process of negotiating a potential cooperation agreement regarding research and development of further indications for Ameluz for the treatment of acne. In March 2019, Maruho and the company signed a non-binding term sheet with respect to this potential collaboration. A proof of concept trial and maximal use pharmacokinetic-trial are planned, the costs of which would be borne by Maruho in an amount that has not yet been agreed. Depending on initial results and agreement of the parties, among other factors, these trials might be followed by additional clinical trials required for the U.S. market approval of further indications. The term sheet contemplates that the company would grant Maruho a license for marketing Ameluz in parts of Asia and the Oceania, the terms and conditions of which have not yet been negotiated.\\n\\nCosmetic Skin Care Products \\x97 Belixos\\n\\nThe company\\x92s Belixos line is its over-the-counter line of skin care cosmetics products developed by it to help moisturize and soothe dry, itchy and irritated or sun-damaged skin. Its Belixos cosmetic products are available for sale in Germany and certain other European countries at selected pharmacies, dermatological institutes, and through local Amazon Websites.\\n\\nStrategy\\n\\nThe key elements of the company\\x92s strategy include geographic expansion of Ameluz sales worldwide, including by expanding its sales in the U.S. of Ameluz in combination with its BF-RhodoLED lamp for the treatment of minimally to moderately thick actinic keratosis of the face and scalp and positioning Ameluz to be a major PDT product in the U.S., by growing its sales and marketing infrastructure in the U.S.; and expanding its sales of Ameluz in other countries where it is an approved product by entering into arrangements with distribution partners.\\n\\nThe key elements of the company's strategy also include the extension of the approved indications for Ameluz PDT, including by seeking to extend the approved label for actinic keratosis to include actinic keratosis lesions located other than on the head or scalp and increase the maximal size of the treatment field; seeking to extend the approved indications in the U.S. for Ameluz in combination with its BF-RhodoLED lamp for the treatment of basal cell carcinoma; and seeking to extend the approved indications in the EU and U.S. for Ameluz to additional indications, such as squamous cell carcinoma in situ, actinic cheilitis, acne, warts, wound healing, and/or cutaneous leichmania, all of which would require further clinical trials, and other research and development activities.\\n\\nSales, marketing and distribution\\n\\nSales, Marketing and Distribution in Europe and Israel\\n\\nWith its central European approval, Ameluz for the PDT treatment of actinic keratosis and basal cell carcinoma, could be sold and distributed in all EU countries, as well as in Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. The company has marketed and sold Ameluz to dermatologists in Germany and also in Spain through its own field sales force. It also started to market and sell in the U.K. through its own sales force beginning April 2018. It sells Ameluz in other countries within the European Union, in Switzerland and in Israel through license partners.\\n\\nAs of December 31, 2018, in Europe, the company or its license partners have commenced sales in Germany, Spain, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the U.K., as well as Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In addition to regular visits by the company\\x92s field sales force to dermatologists, it presents Ameluz at major dermatological conferences both in Germany and in other European countries.\\n\\nThe company has a license and supply agreement with Desitin Arzneimittel GmbH to market and sell Ameluz and the BF-RhodoLED lamp in Denmark, Sweden, and Norway; and it has a license and supply agreement with Pelpharma Handels GmbH to market and sell Ameluz and the BF-RhodoLED lamp in Austria.\\n\\nIn 2015, the company terminated a marketing collaboration agreement with Spirit Healthcare Limited to market Ameluz in the U.K. and Ireland. In April 2018, the company began marketing its products in the U.K. through its own sales force.\\n\\nThe company initially marketed and sold Ameluz in Spain pursuant to an agreement with Allergan SA. After termination of this agreement, as of March 2015, the company has marketed and sold its products in Spain through its branch, Biofrontera Pharma GmbH sucursal en España.\\n\\nThe company has a license and supply agreement with Louis Widmer SA in which it has granted a distribution license for Ameluz and the BF-RhodoLED lamp in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. It has a license and supply agreement with Perrigo Israel Agencies Ltd. in which it has granted a distribution license for Ameluz and the BF-RhodoLED lamp in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. In these regions, the licensees were required to obtain independent regulatory approvals in collaboration with the company. In Switzerland, the regulatory approvals for Ameluz and reimbursement were issued in December 2015 and commercial launch commenced in the beginning of 2016. In Israel, regulatory approval for Ameluz was granted by the Israeli health agency in April 2016, reimbursement for treatment with Ameluz of immunosuppressed patients was subsequently granted. The company commenced sales in Israel in August 2017.\\n\\nSales, Marketing and Distribution in the U.S.\\n\\nThe company markets and sells Ameluz in combination with its BF-RhodoLED lamp for the treatment of actinic keratosis in the U.S. with its own sales force, and launched the commercialization of Ameluz and its BF-RhodoLED lamp for actinic keratosis in October 2016.

       "  'description': 'Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company focuses on researching, developing, and commercializing medicines that address unmet treatment needs for rare and rheumatic diseases in the United States and internationally.\\n\\nSegments\\n\\nOrphan and Rheumdatology\\n\\nThis segment includes the company\\x92s marketed medicines KRYSTEXXA, RAVICTI, PROCYSBI, ACTIMMUNE, RAYOS, BUPHENYL and QUINSAIR.\\n\\nKRYSTEXXA\\n\\nA PEGylated uric acid specific enzyme (uricase), KRYSTEXXA is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), approved medicine for the treatment of uncontrolled gout. KRYSTEXXA has a mechanism of action that rapidly reverses disease progression. Unlike conventional XOI therapies, which address the over-production or under-excretion of uric acid, KRYSTEXXA converts uric acid into allantoin, a water-soluble molecule.\\n\\nRAVICTI\\n\\nRAVICTI is indicated for use as a nitrogen-binding agent for chronic management of adult and pediatric patients two months of age and older with urea cycle disorders (UCDs) that cannot be managed by dietary protein restriction and/or amino acid supplementation alone.\\n\\nThe company\\x92s strategy for RAVICTI is to drive growth through increased awareness and diagnosis of UCDs, to drive conversion from older-generation nitrogen scavengers, such as generic forms of sodium phenylbutyrate, to RAVICTI, based on the medicine\\x92s differentiated benefits and to increase awareness of label expansion to position RAVICTI as first line of therapy.\\n\\nIn 2018, the company sold its rights to RAVICTI outside of North America and Japan to Immedica. The company has retained rights to RAVICTI in North America and Japan.\\n\\nPROCYSBI\\n\\nPROCYSBI is indicated for nephropathic cystinosis (NC), a rare and life-threatening metabolic disorder. PROCYSBI capsules contain cysteamine bitartrate in the form of microspheronized beads that are individually coated to create delayed and extended-release properties, allowing patients to maintain consistent therapeutic systemic drug levels over a twelve-hour dosing period.\\n\\nThe company\\x92s strategy for PROCYSBI is to drive conversion of patients from Cystagon to PROCYSBI, increase the uptake of diagnosed but untreated patients, identify previously undiagnosed patients who are suitable for treatment and increase awareness of label expansion to position PROCYSBI as first line of therapy.\\n\\nACTIMMUNE\\n\\nACTIMMUNE is indicated for chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and severe, malignant osteopetrosis (SMO). It is a biologically manufactured protein called interferon gamma-1b that is similar to a protein the human body makes naturally. Interferon gamma helps prevent infection in CGD patients and enhances osteoclast function in SMO patients. ACTIMMUNE is the medicine approved by the FDA to reduce the frequency and severity of serious infections associated with CGD and for delaying disease progression in patients with SMO.\\n\\nThe company\\x92s strategy for ACTIMMUNE includes driving growth by increasing awareness and diagnosis of CGD and increasing the persistence of and adherence to treatment.\\n\\nRAYOS\\n\\nRAYOS is indicated for the treatment of multiple conditions: rheumatoid arthritis (RA); ankylosing spondylitis (AS); polymyalgia rheumatic; primary systemic amyloidosis; asthma; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; systemic lupus erythematosus; and a number of other conditions.\\n\\nRAYOS is composed of an active core containing prednisone that is encapsulated by an inactive porous shell, and acts as a barrier between the medicine\\x92s active core and the patient\\x92s gastrointestinal, or GI, fluids.

       "  'description': 'Zealand Pharma A/S, a biotechnology company, focuses on the discovery, design and development of peptide-based medicines.\\n\\nThe company\\x92s pipeline of internal product candidates focuses on specialty gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases. Its portfolio also includes two clinical license collaborations with Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH.\\n\\nThe company has four fully owned programs in late clinical development:\\n\\nGlepaglutide is a long acting GLP-2 analog in development for the treatment of short bowel syndrome (SBS). The pivotal Phase 3 trial in various patients was initiated in 2018 with expected results by mid- 2020. Dasiglucagon is a invented proprietary glucagon analog in development for three indications:\\n\\nDasiglucagon in Dual-hormone Pump Therapy for Diabetes Treatment: The company reported positive results from two Phase 2a trials during the second quarter of 2017, and the initiation of a small Phase 2b trial in iLet dual-hormone artificial pancreas system is planned for 2019.\\n\\nDasiglucagon Hypoplal Rescue Pen for Severe Hypoglycemia: Ready-to-use dasiglucagon might offer diabetes patients and their families a treatment solution for severe hypoglycemia. The pivotal Phase 3 trial with dasiglucagon for the treatment of severe hypoglycemia was completed with results in 2018. A pediatric Phase 3 trial was initiated in the end of 2018, with results expected in H2 2019.\\n\\nDasiglucagon for Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI): CHI is a disease caused by inappropriately elevated insulin secretion irrespective of glucose levels. This leads to frequent and often severe hypoglycemia and long-term irreversible damage to health. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. and the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products in the EU issued a positive opinion on an orphan medicinal product application for the company\\x92s glucagon analog. In January 2018, the FDA issued a safe-to-proceed letter, and a first Phase 3 trial started in Q1 2019. In addition to the late stage clinical programs, the company also has a pipeline of pre-clinical programs with the potential to enter into the clinic in 2019 and the years to come.\\n\\nPatents\\n\\nThe company owns one patent family covering lixisenatide, including 45 non-U.S. patents in 10 non-U.S. jurisdictions, all licensed to Sanofi S.A. It owns two patent families covering two related proprietary GLP-2 analogs, glepaglutide and elsiglutide or backup candidates. These two patent families include 59 non-U.S. patents in 16 non-U.S. jurisdictions and 7 pending patent applications in 4 jurisdictions.\\n\\nThe company (or its wholly owned subsidiary, ZP Holding, in the case of lixisenatide) owns various patents and applications, as relating to lixisenatide, elsiglutide, glepaglutide and dasiglucagon.\\n\\nLixisenatide: ZP Holding owns two patent families covering lixisenatide compound and compositions, methods of using lixisenatide and dosing regimens for administering lixisenatide. The first patent family includes granted patents in Europe (one European patent validated in 25 countries and a second European patent validated in 18 countries), the United States, Australia (two), Canada, China, Hong Kong (two), India, Israel (three), Japan (three), New Zealand and South Africa. The patents include composition of matter claims covering both the peptide and composition of lixisenatide, originally known as ZP10. The granted U.S. patent originally claimed lixisenatide and related analogs of lixisenatide, but was reissued with claims covering lixisenatide only. The closely related analogs might be pursued in various continuing applications. The granted European patents include claims drawn to the composition of matter of a genus of compounds that encompasses lixisenatide and of lixisenatide, compositions comprising lixisenatide, and uses of lixisenatide to treat various diseases, including type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes and obesity. The patents in this patent family have an expiration date in July 2020 and might be eligible for approximately 5 years of regulatory patent term extension in various jurisdictions, including certain European jurisdictions, Japan, Israel and the United States.\\n\\nElsiglutide and Glepaglutide: The company owns two patent families, which include 59 non-U.S. patents and 16 pending non-U.S. applications in a total of 54 non-U.S. jurisdictions. The first patent family discloses both the elsiglutide compound and the glepaglutide compound, which are structurally-related GLP-2 receptor agonists developed using its SIP technology.\\n\\nThe first patent family includes six granted U.S. patents and one granted European patent (validated in 30 countries). The first patent family also includes granted patents in Australia, Canada, China (two), Eurasia (designated in 9 countries), Hong Kong, Israel (three), India(two), Japan (thre), South Korea (three), Mexico, New Zealand (three), Ukraine and South Africa(two). The granted U.S. patents include composition of matter claims covering both the peptide and composition of elsiglutide and glepaglutide, and claims drawn to a method of treating CID by administering elsiglutide and a method of treating inflammatory bowel disease by administering glepaglutide. The granted European patent includes claims drawn to the composition of matter of a genus of compounds that encompasses elsiglutide and glepaglutide and of elsiglutide and glepaglutide, as well as analogs thereof and methods of using elsiglutide and glepaglutide for the preparation of a medicament to treat or prevent side effects of chemotherapy, including diarrhea. Twelve applications are pending in this family in the U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, including Brazil, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Norway and South Africa. The patents in this patent family have a nominal expiration date in May 2026, with the exception of one of the granted U.S. patents, which has an adjusted expiration date in June 2026.\\n\\nA second patent family covers backup compounds for elsiglutide. This family includes granted patents in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand (two), Ukraine and the United States. The second family also includes seven pending patent applications in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Eurasia, Europe, Norway and South Africa. The patents in this second family have a nominal expiration date in November 2027, with the exception of the granted U.S. patent, which has an adjusted expiration date in February 2030.\\n\\nThe patents in each of these patent families were licensed to Helsinn for elsiglutide until June 2017. With the termination of the license agreement with Helsinn, the company is responsible for the maintenance of both patent families.\\n\\nDasiglucagon: The company owns one patent family covering dasiglucagon, including granted patents in 13 European countries and 19 patent applications outstanding in 18 jurisdictions. The pending claims in this patent family cover the dasiglucagon compound and a group of structurally related compounds having glucagon agonist activity and increased solubility and/or stability relative to the native glucagon. The pending claims also cover pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and related uses for treating various diseases, including hypoglycemia, type 1 and 2 diabetes and other metabolic conditions, and nucleic acid molecules for expression of the compounds in host cells. The patents in this family, when issued, would have a nominal expiration date in July 2033.\\n\\nResearch and Development\\n\\nThe company\\x92s research and development expenses were Danish kroner 324.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\\n\\nCompetition\\n\\nThe company competes with companies that are producing drugs for, among other disease indications, SBS, such as Takeda plc, which markets and distributes Gattex, and hypoglycemia, such as Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, which each market and distribute glucagon rescue kits.\\n\\nSignificant Events\\n\\nIn March 2019, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Zealand Pharma A/S announced a collaboration to discover and develop peptide therapies for complement-mediated diseases. The agreement provides Alexion with exclusive worldwide licenses, as well as development and commercial rights, for approximately four targets within the complement pathway. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion and Zealand would enter into an exclusive collaboration for the discovery and development of subcutaneously delivered peptide therapies directed to approximately four complement pathway targets. Zealand would lead the joint discovery and research efforts through the preclinical stage, and Alexion would lead development efforts beginning with IND filing and Phase 1 studies. The agreement provides Alexion with exclusive worldwide licenses and commercial rights to the peptide therapies developed in the collaboration.\\n\\nIn May 2019, Beta Bionics, Inc. and Zealand Pharma A/S announced the first patients dosed in a clinical trial investigating the home-use of dasiglucagon in the iLet Bionic Pancreas System.
