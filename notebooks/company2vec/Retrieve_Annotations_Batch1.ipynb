    "33\tPKT Logistics\tFounded in 1974 by Datuk Tio Sook Keo (Tio Senior), PKT Logistics Group Sdn Bhd (PKTG) is a Malaysia-based logistics solution provider and auto parts retailer. ~58% of the Group revenue comes from sale of automotive parts, handled by wholly owned subsidiary, Orisis Freight Logistics (M) Sdn Bhd (Orisis). PKTG’s operations further include end-to-end design, implementation, and operation of logistics solutions in freight forwarding, customs brokering, contract logistics, haulage, warehousing, and distribution management through Orisis as well as another subsidiary PKT Logistics (M) Sdn Bhd (PKTM). PKTM accounts for 31% of FY18 revenues, 74% assets, and 99% debt at PKTG and Orisis contributes 69% revenue with almost nil debt. Tio Senior was joined by Datuk Michael Tio (Tio Junior) in 1996. Post Tio Junior coming onboard the focus of the Company was shifted to automotive logistics in Malaysia since 2001. Apart from auto logistics, PKTG caters to Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), Food & Beverage (F&B), and renewable energy sectors. Majority of PKTG’s operations are in Malaysia. It also has some presence in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Taiwan, India and South Korea. By 2020, PKTG had aimed to achieve (a) 60:40 contribution between automotive and non-automotive segments (vs. >80% auto contribution in 2016), (b) 70:30 contribution by domestic and international revenue (Malaysia contributed >70% as of Sep 2016), (c) Warehouse capacity of 5Mn sq.ft. in Asia (1.2Mn sq.ft. at FY18), and (d) revenue of MYR1Bn (MYR0.7Mn in FY18). However, given the performance till date, it is unlikely that the Company will hit these targets by next year. \t Not found\tAsia Pacific\tMYR 693mn\tLogistics\t\t\n",
